# dynamic-pricing-for-fitness-classes
A data-driven project to develop a dynamic pricing strategy for fitness classes. Leverages Python, pandas, and machine learning to analyze booking trends, forecast demand, and create an algorithm for price optimization.
Dynamic Pricing Strategy for Fitness Classes
Project Summary
This project's goal was to develop a dynamic pricing strategy for fitness classes using historical booking data. The work was completed as part of a virtual internship with Cult.Fit, in collaboration with Mentormind.

The analysis revealed that a static pricing model was inefficient. By using a data-driven approach, a more effective pricing strategy could be implemented to maximize revenue and optimize class attendance.

Key Tasks Performed
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Cleaned raw booking data, handled missing values and outliers, and prepared the dataset for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed booking trends, identified seasonal demand, and pinpointed the most popular class types and times using visualizations.

Price Elasticity Model Development: Built and validated a multiple linear regression model that explained over 80% of the variance in class bookings. This proved that factors like class type and time of day are stronger predictors of demand than price alone.

Demand Forecasting: Developed a time-series forecasting model to predict future booking trends, which helps in strategic planning and scheduling.

Dynamic Pricing Algorithm: Created a Python script to simulate a dynamic pricing algorithm. The algorithm adjusts prices in real-time based on class popularity, time of day, and current demand levels.

Technology Stack
Python: The core language used for all analysis and modeling.

Pandas: Essential for data manipulation and cleaning.

Scikit-learn: Used for building and validating the regression models.

Prophet: A powerful library for time-series forecasting.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Used for data visualization and exploratory analysis.

Jupyter Notebooks: The primary environment for development and documentation.
